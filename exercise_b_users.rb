# 1. Get Jonathan's Twitter handle (i.e. the string `"jonnyt"`)
p users["Jonathan"][:twitter]

# 2. Get Erik's hometown
p users["Erik"][:home_town]

# 3. Get the array of Erik's lottery numbers
p users["Erik"][:lottery_numbers]

#4. Get the type of Avril's pet Monty
p users["Avril"][:pets][0][:species]
# it's an array! so you need the zero.
# I thought the hw code was wrong so I changed it! took out
# brackets to make it a hash. So code works sans [0]. But that's wrong.
# all the other [:pets] are in arrays, so pay attention to errors and pattern!

# 5. Get the smallest of Erik's lottery numbers
p users["Erik"][:lottery_numbers].min()

# 6. Return an array of Avril's lottery numbers that are even
users["Avril"][:lottery_numbers].each {|x| p x if x % 2 == 0}
# oops this is not an array!

# class example:
lott_av = users["Avril"][:lottery_numbers]
result = []
for number in lott_av
  if number % 2 == 0
    result << number
  end
end

p result

#Â or someone did this...it's neat
p users["Avril"][:lottery_numbers].select{|x| x.even?}

# # 7. Erik is one lottery number short! Add the number `7` to be included in his lottery numbers
p users["Erik"][:lottery_numbers].push(7)

# 8. Change Erik's hometown to Edinburgh
users["Erik"][:home_town] = "Edinburgh"

# 9. Add a pet dog to Erik called "Fluffy"
users["Erik"][:pets].push({:name => "Fluffy",
:species => "dog"})
# can also use a shovel <<

# 10. Add another person to the users hash
